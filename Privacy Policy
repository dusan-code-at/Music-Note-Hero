1. Data Collection Overview

Music Note Hero is designed with user privacy in mind.

1.1. Personal Data

The App does NOT collect, store, or process any personal data.
We do not request or access:

Name

Email address

Location data

Contacts

Advertising identifiers

Device identifiers linked to you

1.2. Optional Anonymous Gameplay Events

If applicable in certain builds of the App, Music Note Hero may collect anonymous, non-personal gameplay events solely to improve the game’s performance and user experience. These events may include:

session_started — anonymous event triggered when gameplay begins

session_end — anonymous event triggered when gameplay ends

premium_clicked — anonymous event showing interactions with premium features or buttons

note_telemetry — anonymous event describing gameplay actions (e.g., notes hit/missed), without identifying the player

These events contain no personal information, cannot identify you, and are never used for tracking or advertising.

2. How Anonymous Data Is Used

If these anonymous events are collected, they may be used for:

Understanding gameplay flow

Improving difficulty balancing

Identifying bugs or performance issues

Enhancing game design

Understanding feature usage

We do not sell data, share data with advertisers, or use data for profiling.

3. Legal Basis (GDPR)

If anonymous gameplay telemetry is collected, it is processed under:

Legitimate Interest
To ensure the App functions properly and to improve user experience.
This data does not identify you in any way.

Since no personal data is collected, GDPR rights concerning identifiable information do not apply in most cases.

4. Third-Party Services

Music Note Hero may use platform-provided analytics or crash reporting tools (e.g., Apple’s built-in services).
These tools collect only anonymized technical information required to maintain app stability and performance.

No advertising networks or trackers are used.

5. International Data Transfers

If anonymous telemetry is processed by third-party tools, it may be transferred internationally according to their security and compliance standards (such as GDPR SCCs).
No personal data is ever transferred.

6. Children’s Privacy

The App does not collect personal data from any users, including children.
Anonymous gameplay events contain no identifiable information.

7. Security

We use reasonable technical measures to ensure that any anonymous data handled by the App or its providers is secure.
Because no personal information is processed, risk to users is extremely low.

8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated. Updates will be published in the App Store listing or inside the App.
Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any changes.
