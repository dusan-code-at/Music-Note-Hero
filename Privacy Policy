Last updated: 16.11.2025

## Who we are
Music Sheet Hero is a music sight-reading education app. Contact: dusan.rajlic [with numbers: ONE] [at] gmail.com.

## Children’s Privacy
- This app is suitable for and may be used by children.
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond what is reasonably necessary to operate the app.
- Parents/guardians can contact us at [EMAIL] to review or request deletion of any information related to their child.

## Data We Collect and Why
- Usage telemetry (non-identifying): event names like `session_started`, `session_completed`, `session_abandoned`, `highscores_viewed`, `highscores_cleared`, `toast_shown`, and the platform (iOS/Android). Purpose: basic product diagnostics and improvement.
- Local-only data on device: high scores and app preferences (e.g., zoom level, settings like solfege/labels) stored locally using AsyncStorage to provide app functionality.

## What We Do NOT Collect
- No names, email addresses, phone numbers, photos, precise location, contacts, or payment info.
- No microphone recording; audio is playback only.
- No advertising identifiers; no behavioral ads or third‑party ad tracking.

## Data Sharing and Storage
- Telemetry is sent to our private Google Sheets endpoint and not shared with external parties except as required by law.
- We do not sell personal data.

## Parental Rights
Parents/guardians can:
- Request access to telemetry entries reasonably linkable to use of the app,
- Request deletion of such entries,
- Withdraw consent to further collection by contacting the listed contact.
We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

## International Users
Data may be processed and stored in Austria/EU. By using the app, you consent to this processing.

## Security
We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate for the limited data we collect.

## Retention
Telemetry is retained only as long as necessary for diagnostics and service improvement, then deleted or de-identified. Local device data remains on your device until you clear it or delete the app.

## Your Choices
- You can disable telemetry by not using the app or contacting us for deletion requests of previously logged events.
- Delete the app to remove on-device data.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above.
